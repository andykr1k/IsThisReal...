          We need to give power back to the people. Since the beginning of
          computer programs, there has been a strong open source community which
          has created a movement for giving the people their own power. Less
          dependency on the government and corporations has always been the
          motive. From the founding fathers to now, we have seen a drastic
          change in the rights of the people hence why the open source community
          has become so prominent. This shall not change, in fact it must grow
          stronger. With all this in mind, the motivation of this small tool is
          to give some fact checking confidence back to the people. AI
          researchers have created a powerful tool of Video Generation, now we
          need to create powerful tools to help combat the sick and vile people
          who will and have used technology against the people.
