## Motivation

We need to give power back to the people. Since the beginning of computer programs, there has been a strong open source community which has created a movement for giving the people their own power. Less dependency on the government and corporations has always been the motive. From the founding fathers to now, we have seen a drastic change in the rights of the people hence why the open soure community has become so prominent. This shall not change, in fact it must grow stronger. With all this in mind, the motivation of this small tool is to give some fact checking confidence back to the people. AI researchers have created a powerful tool of Video Generation, now we need to create powerful tools to help combat the sick and vile people who will and have used technology against the people.
